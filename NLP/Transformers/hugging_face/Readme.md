It introduces the concept of **pipelines** in the Hugging Face Transformers library, which connect models with preprocessing and postprocessing steps. It explains how pipelines can be used for tasks such as **sentiment analysis, zero-shot classification, text generation, mask filling, named entity recognition, question answering, summarization, and translation**. Examples and code snippets are provided to demonstrate the usage of these pipelines. It also highlights the availability of pretrained models in the **Hugging Face Model Hub** and the option to upload custom models. It concludes by mentioning the **Inference API**.
