`01_Intro_to_diffusion_and_diffusers`-  It offers a comprehensive introduction to the ðŸ¤— Diffusers library, which is 
focused on diffusion models for image generation. The notebook covers the fundamental components of the library, 
including **Pipelines**, **Models** (specifically UNet), and **Schedulers**, illustrating their roles in image 
generation and training. A focus on building a Minimum Viable Pipeline (MVP) showcases steps to construct a pipeline 
for generating butterfly images from scratch, employing a small dataset and a training loop. Additionally, it explains 
image generation techniques and outlines procedures for pushing the model to the Hugging Face Hub.
